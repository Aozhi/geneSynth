[Algorithmic Composition with Genetic Algorithms in Max-MSP](https://youtu.be/P9vE0Oe6dFw).

This repository currently contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm as a Java External and an accompanying Max-MSP Patch. The Processing sketches for the visuals are coming soon.

## Instructions
You need to configure Max/MSP and Eclipse (or any other IDE) for Java externals. Fortunately, a couple of good tutorials are out there.
    - [Max MSP Development with Eclipse](http://compusition.com/writings/maxmsp-eclipse)
    - [Writing Max Externals in Java](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/geers001/compmusprog2007/WritingMaxExternalsInJava.pdf)
  
For simplicity, I've included the entire Eclipse project, which you can [import directly](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm).

If the projects and the path are set up correctly, you should be able to use the Max patch and [create some music](https://soundcloud.com/chaoticambivalence/relativity)!
