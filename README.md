This repository currently contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm as a Java External and an accompanying Max-MSP Patch. The Processing sketches for the visuals are coming soon.

For simplicity, I've included the entire Eclipse project, which you can [http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm](import directly).

If the projects and the path are set up correctly, you should be able to use the Max patch and [https://soundcloud.com/chaoticambivalence/relativity](create some music)!
